Hello, this is a change

This article goes in depth about the difference between computer science and software engineering. It was interesting to see how the list of jobs that are related to each major was very different. This article advises that students should choose Computer Science if they are interested in math, logic, and specialized fields like AI, Machine Learning, or graphics. If you are more interested in hands-on approach and the overall life cycle of how software is built, Software Engineering might be a better option.Â
